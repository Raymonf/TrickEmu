# TrickEmu
TrickEmu is a WIP emulator for Trickster Online 0.50 licensed under AGPLv3. Any complaints about the license go to [@PyroSamurai](https://github.com/PyroSamurai).

The "TEMethods" project is not ready for release yet, but it *should* be added in the future. For now, it is easily recreatable.

### TO-DO
Pretty much everything except for the finished stuff. The list includes:
* Better networking
* Actual character selection data
* Character creation
* Character deletion
* Character movement
* Character equipment
* Character inventory
* Character etc.

### Finished
* Capturing basic login packets
* Selecting a server (127.0.0.1)
* Connecting to a game server (127.0.0.1)
* Chat, minus the message box on the top of the player
* A basic GM chat command (!gmc)
