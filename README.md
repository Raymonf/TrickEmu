* Better networking
* A database (MySQL)
* Real accounts
* Character creation
* Character deletion
* Character movement
* Character equipment
* Character inventory
* Character etc.

### Finished
* Capturing basic login packets
* Selecting a server (127.0.0.1)
* Connecting to a game server (127.0.0.1)
* Chat, minus the message box on the top of the player
* A basic GM chat command (!gmc)
