* Character movement
* Character equipment
* Character inventory
* Character etc.

### Finished but not working
* Chat box above the player's head
* Sitting (semi-finished)
* "Personal notice" (that's what the Chinese translates to! I forgot what it is in English.)

### Finished
* Capturing basic login packets
* Selecting a server (127.0.0.1)

* Chat, minus the message box on the top of the player
* A basic GM chat command (!gmc)
